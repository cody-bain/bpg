## About
My name is Cody Bain, I'm a veteran, outdoorsman, dog-dad, and avid CrossFitter. Growing up on a few acres in Western PA, land has always made sense to me. As kids, we built forts, conquered and explored, caught bugs, hid from our parents, got into trouble, discovered who we were, and made core memories on that property.

I'll always have an emotional attachment to the land I grew up on and I'm certain you share a similar story. 

As such, I understand that it's no easy decision to sell your property. But with Bain Property Group (BPG), your land is in good hands. We're a **veteran-owned** and **family operated** small business that takes pride in honoring American soil. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

## Background
Land is my passion. I founded BPG in 2019 while active-duty. Since then, my company has purchased properties all over the continental US. In those 5 years, we've completed **100+ transactions** with people just like you.

## Our Process
Every transaction is based on **trust**. I encourage you to text, call, or email me so we can get to know one another and decide if doing business together is in our best interest. 

Once we decide on terms, my team will help facilitate a seamless transactions. I can typically get cash in your hands within **10 business days**. Additionally, I will pay for all associated closing costs. The sale price we agree upon, is the amount you will receive. No hidden surprises or fees.
