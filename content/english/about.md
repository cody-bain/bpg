Bain Property Group, LLC was founded in 2019 while I was still active-duty military and searching for potential long-term investments.

Somehow, while listening to yet another real estate investing podcast, I heard a guest mention land investing. Immediately I was hooked and sought to learn everything I could about buying land. Well **5 years and 100+ transactions** later BPG is still here buying land!

As a veteran-owned company I take pride in my work and facilitating seamless transactions. I typically can get cash in your hands within **10 business days**. Additionally, I will pay for any associated closing costs.

If you're remotely interested in selling your land, I encourage you to reach out via the contact form on this site. I'll be in touch within **24 hours** and we can discuss terms and a price that works for you.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

*P.S. BPG is not associated with any realtors. We purchase all properties outright as our own investment.*
