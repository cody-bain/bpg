## About
My name is Cody Bainâ€”veteran, outdoorsman, dog enthusiast, and dedicated CrossFitter. Growing up on several acres in Western Pennsylvania, I've always felt a deep connection to land. As kids, we built forts, explored, and created lasting memories on that property.

The attachment to the land where I grew up will always hold meaning for me, and I believe many share that sentiment.

I understand that selling your property can be a difficult decision. At Bain Property Group (BPG), your land is treated with the respect it deserves. We're a veteran-owned, family-operated business that prides itself on honoring American soil. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

## Background
Land is more than a business for meâ€”it's my passion. I founded BPG in 2019 while on active duty, and since then, weâ€™ve been fortunate to purchase properties across the continental U.S. In the past five years, weâ€™ve successfully completed over 100 transactions with landowners just like you.

## Our Process
Every transaction we make is built on trust. I encourage you to reach out via text, call, or email so we can discuss your goals and see if working together is a good fit.

Once we agree on terms, my team handles everything to ensure a smooth transaction. In most cases, I can get cash in your hands within 10 business days. Plus, I cover all closing costsâ€”what we agree on is exactly what you'll receive. No hidden fees or surprises.
